# Mentors-Recommender-System
This is a web application that links university students to industry professionals by means of providing personalized suggestions of mentors to the students and enabling them to search for mentors on the platform as well. Suggestions are given of mentors who are similar to a mentor a student has interacted with based on the similarity of their professional summaries, which detail their skills, qualifications and career achievements. The recommendation algorithm is essentially a content-based filter based on natural language processing techniques to understand the text of individual profiles and calculate their similarity.
